# ðŸ§¢ Maintenance

This stack will deploy a t2.nano EC2 instance with auto shutdown - useful for maintenance work in AWS.

On a regular basis we have to do maintenance work in clients AWS accounts, for example:

- Do a DB migration.
- Move objects form one S3 Bucket to another.
- Check different volumes types.
- etc.

We got tired of creating an instance and waiting for it to boot, installing some default tools, and then remember to either shut it down, or termiante it.

This stack solves this problem by making a EC2 Instance, installing all the tools that we need at boot time, and then automatically shut it down after 30 minutes if the ec2-user session is idle. This way we always have access to our Maintenance server, and we don't have worry that our clients have to pay for unused resources.

The stack takes advantage of just EC2.

- 1x EC2 Instance with auto shut down.

# Pricing

Standard t2.nano Pricing applies when the instance is ON.

# How to work with this project

When you want to deploy the stack, the only file you should be interested in is the `CloudFormation.json` file. If you'd like to modify the stack, we recommend that you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes), which was designed to make it easier to work with the CloudFormation file. If you'd like to keep your sanity, never edit the main CF file ðŸ¤ª.
